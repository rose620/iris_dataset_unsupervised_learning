# iris_dataset_unsupervised_learning
utilize unsupervised machine learning models such as kmeans classification, determine ideal cluster no and cross-tabulate results in order to classify the different species of the iris dataset. Also included supervised machine learning of the same dataset using knn classifer and determing the optimum k that gives highest test accuracy.
